## Why I Started My Technical Blog


It’s been 5 years since I started my career as a Software Engineer. 
During this time, I’ve learned a lot both at work and in graduate school. However, human memory fades quickly. If I don’t record my thoughts and experiences, all of it can be lost.  

To become a better engineer, I want to **capture what I learn, reflect on my experiences, and take the time to think and write**.  

Here are the main things I plan to write about:

- Studies from graduate school (AI, Machine Learning)  
- System design and engineering practices  
- Daily life and personal reflections

I plan to **publish at least two posts every week**, so I can consistently share what I learn and experience
